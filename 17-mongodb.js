/* MongoDB is a NoSQL database which uses collections and documents instead of tables/rows/columns as in relational SQL databases (like MySQL). NoSQL focuses on scaling, fast queries, allowing for frequent application changes, and making programming simpler for developers. Relational databases accessed with SQL focuses on reducing data duplication as storage was much more costly than developer time in the 1970s when it was developed.  


NoSQL collections can hold many documents of one type only, so to create different types of documents, you need to create new collections. In this app, we'll create a collection for blog posts. The collection will contain only blog documents. Documents (docs) are written in the same key-value syntax as JSON objects.

To use MongoDB, we can install it locally or use a cloud version hosted online. The cloud version is easier to set up and it's called MongoDB Atlas. They both require the same code to program, so it's better to use the cloud version for learning.
